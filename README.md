Hi, I'm Kyle LeBlanc 👋

Full-Stack Software Engineer | React, TypeScript, Node.js, Prisma | Scalable Systems & Performance Optimization

👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a full-stack engineer from Ottawa, Canada with 2+ years of hands-on experience building scalable applications, optimizing backend infrastructure, and delivering high-impact features across React, TypeScript, Node.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.
I began my career as an intern while working full-time in construction, taught myself software engineering, and quickly progressed into a full-time developer role — eventually leading major platform migrations and performance initiatives.
I’ve contributed extensively to Trace, a sneaker consignment SaaS platform (formerly Habit App / Unit 203), improving performance, architecture, and stability across the entire stack.
I care deeply about writing clean code, solving meaningful problems, and continuously improving my craft.
