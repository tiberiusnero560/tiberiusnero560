<h1>Thanks for checking out my page ! </h1>

<h3> My Story...so far </h3>
<p> I am a self taught Software, web developer and entrepreneur in progress. Like many others, I was unsure of what exactly I wanted to do with my life for some time.
I first tried to go to school out of high school for video game development. I quickly ran into issues and ultimately, only finished 2 semesters. I believe this was a blessing
in disguise. We are often told we need to go to college or university, but I think we don't talk nearly enough about the fact that you may not enjoy the career you chose right 
out of high school. Sometimes, it's better to explore different things, and ultimately fail until you find something.

Now, I have committed to learning new skills, growing my personal brand, attempting new and extraordinary things and understanding that failing is just testing. 
I waited far to long to start this, but I am finally doing it. This page will evolve and grow as I do, and I intend for it to become something extradordinary as I complete project, after project, after project.

<h3> The Future </h3>
<p> I am looking to network with likeminded people, contribute to open source projects and continue to grow my portfolio of work.
    I believe it's time to start to search for freelance clients for smaller projects to add real industry experience while I continue my job search for 
    something in the industry. This is because I understand that for me to be taken seriously with a tech company of my own, the first question I will be asked will be, "What       tech background do you have?". <br> <br>
    This is me creating the answer to that question right now.
