<h3> My Story...so far </h3>
<p>I am a <strong>Ryerson University Computer Science</strong> student currently taking courses one at a time starting May 07 2021 - Ending July 23 2021 (Computer science I)<br>
   I will also be adding a Cyber Security course into the mix during my learning at Ryerson. I am doing my learning online remotely, continuing to document my journey and          enjoying the process, not just looking towards the destination. 

Now, I have committed to learning new skills, growing my personal brand, attempting new and extraordinary things and understanding that failing is just testing. 
I waited far to long to start this, but I am finally doing it. This page will evolve and grow as I do, and I intend for it to become something extradordinary as I complete project, after project, after project.

<h3> The Future </h3>
<p> I am looking to network with likeminded people, contribute to open source projects and continue to grow my portfolio of work.
    I believe it's time to start to search for freelance clients for smaller projects to add real industry experience while I continue my job search for 
    something in the industry. <br> <br>
    This is because I understand that for me to be taken seriously with a tech company of my own, the first question I will be asked will be, "What       tech background do you     have?". <br> <br>
    This is me creating the answer to that question right now.
